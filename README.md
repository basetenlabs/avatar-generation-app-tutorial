# Building a Lensa-like app with Blueprint

## Background

[Blueprint](https://blueprint.baseten.co) is a fine-tuning and serving infrastructure platform for software developers who are comfortable with backend and frontend engineering but lack expertise in model development and hosting.

Blueprint works great for building user-facing applications with fine-tuned models. One popular type of app using fine-tuning is AI avatar generation apps. This project implements a simple version of an avatar generation app like Lensa using Blueprint.

This repo contains:

* A tutorial on building your own avatar generation application
* Code snippets for a lightweight front-end and back-end application that allows users to authenticate, upload some data, and kick-off a fine-tuning job before allowing them to use their models to generate new photos

## Tutorial
### Prerequisites

* A [Blueprint account](https://blueprint.baseten.co) For fine-tuning, plus a valid API key. https://docs.blueprint.baseten.co/getting-started
* A [Supabase account](https://supabase.com/) for storage and user state management
* A [Vercel account](https://vercel.com) for deploying your NextJS application

### Creating your Next.js App and Setup
We'll be using Next.js for building the front-end, and Supabase for authentication.

To get set up:

```
git clone git@github.com:tuhins/fine-tuning-app.git
npm install
npm run dev
```

Once you clone this repo, you can see the relevant parts of the application:

* [Supabase client](https://github.com/tuhins/fine-tuning-app/blob/main/src/supabaseClient.js#L5)
* [Login page](https://github.com/tuhins/fine-tuning-app/blob/main/src/pages/login.tsx)
* [Main application page](https://github.com/tuhins/fine-tuning-app/blob/main/src/pages/index.tsx)

Follow the instructions [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/tutorials/with-react#create-a-project) to create a basic Supabase project.

Add your `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` to the `.env.local` in the project root folder. The file's contents should look like:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://XXXXXXXX.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YYYYYYYYY
```

### Collecting user data

We're using Supabase storage to collect files from users which we zip up, upload to Supabase and then pass that URL to Blueprint.

First set up a Supabase bucket for storing data. You can follow the [great guide from Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/quickstart#create-a-bucket) to get started (call it something like `fine-tuning-bucket`; if you call it something else you'll have to update the [`index.tsx`](https://github.com/tuhins/fine-tuning-app/blob/559546ad6b5d39d68433d12ee5bc7e5cc9149a3a/src/pages/index.tsx#L15). Make sure to set the policy as open for reading, writing, deleting and updating data; [here](https://github.com/tuhins/fine-tuning-app/blob/01993e44996d152cae92fce5d2475a110079b0b9/images/policy.png) is what your policy should look like. The bulk of the work here is done by the [upload handler](https://github.com/tuhins/fine-tuning-app/blob/main/src/pages/index.tsx#L89-L122), which collects images from the user via an input component, zips them up and uploads the blob to Supabase. Supabase provides a publicly accessible URL to pass through to the Blueprint API.

Next, create a new table in Supabase called `finetuningruns`. We'll be using this table to link users with fine tuning runs created through Blueprint. For this purpose of this demo, disable Row-Level-Security. This table only needs a few columns:
* [`run_id` (_varchar_)](https://github.com/tuhins/fine-tuning-app/blob/01993e44996d152cae92fce5d2475a110079b0b9/images/run_id.png)
* [`user_id` (linked to users table, join on `id`)](https://github.com/tuhins/fine-tuning-app/blob/01993e44996d152cae92fce5d2475a110079b0b9/images/user_id.png)
* [`dataset` (_varchar_)](https://github.com/tuhins/fine-tuning-app/blob/01993e44996d152cae92fce5d2475a110079b0b9/images/dataset.png)

### Fine tuning routes

Blueprint provides a simple SDK — given a set of images, it's straightforward to programmatically schedule fine-tuning jobs, deploy fine-tuned models, and provides an inference API for the deployed model. It also provides a dataset API for validating uploaded user data, but we won't be using that in this demo.

Blueprint also provides a serverless backend to be able to build on top of its fine-tuning SDK. Think of these like Flask routes. We'll set up some serverless routes that interact with the fine-tuning SDK. We'll write this code in the Blueprint web IDE.

**Create a new Blueprint project**

First, we'll get set up on Blueprint.

1. Go to https://app.baseten.co/blueprint/projects
2. Click **New Project**
3. Copy URL with the project ID
4. Back in this repository, go to `index.tsx` and update the [Blueprint project route](https://github.com/tuhins/fine-tuning-app/blob/main/src/pages/index.tsx#L12)

**Quick overview of Blueprint endpoints**

Blueprint endpoints are like serverless functions. They are defined in the `main.py` file accessible via the sidebar in your Blueprint project. They run in a fully-managed environment — its requirements can be defined and managed in the `requirements.txt` file also accessible via the sidebar in your Blueprint project. You can read more about [Blueprint endpoints](https://docs.blueprint.baseten.co/tutorials/endpoint/).

All the code referenced below should be used via Blueprint endpoints. The full-code can be found in the [main.py](https://github.com/tuhins/fine-tuning-app/blob/main/baseten/main.py), and in the [requirements file](https://github.com/tuhins/fine-tuning-app/blob/main/baseten/requirements.txt).

**Endpoint for triggering a fine-tuning job**

We'll create a endpoint that takes the url of a fine-tuning job and a user identifier to trigger a fine-tuning job. Names must be unique, and ensure that permissions on the file are set to open or whatever you can configure from the backend. We'll store a link between the user, the dataset and the fine-tuning run in a Supabase table.

```python
@route(path="/fine_tune_model", allowed_domains=["http://localhost:3000"], allowed_methods=["POST"])
def fine_tune_model(request):
    request_body = request["body"]
    url = request_body.get("url")
    user_id = request_body.get("user_id")
    now = datetime.now() # current date and time
    name_of_model = f'{user_id} training run {now.strftime("%m/%d/%Y, %H:%M:%S")}'
    instance_prompt = request_body.get("prompt")
    dataset = PublicUrl(f'{SUPABASE_PREFIX_URL}{url}')
    config = DreamboothConfig(
        instance_prompt=instance_prompt,
        input_dataset=dataset,
        train_text_encoder=False,
        max_train_steps=20
    )
    run = FinetuningRun.create(
        trained_model_name=name_of_model,
        fine_tuning_config=config,
        auto_deploy=True)
    run_data ={ "run_id": run.id }
    create_or_update_user_data(user_id, url, run.id)
    return run_data


def create_or_update_user_data(user_id, dataset_url, run_id):
    client = get_supabase_client()
    user_data = get_user_data(user_id)
    if user_data:
        data = client.table("finetuningruns").update({
            "run_id": run_id,
            "dataset_url": dataset_url}).eq("user_id", user_id).execute()
    else:
        data = client.table("finetuningruns").insert({
            "user_id": user_id,
            "run_id": run_id,
            "dataset_url": dataset_url
        }).execute()


def get_user_data(user_id):
    client = get_supabase_client()
    data = client.table("finetuningruns").select("*").eq("user_id", user_id).execute()
    if data.data:
        return data.data[0]
    return None
  ```

**Endpoint for checking the status of the model**

Next, we'll create a route to check the status of the fine-tuning and deployment. We don't want hit the model if it's not healthy, and this will allow us to block the user for doing so.

```python
@route(path="/model_status", allowed_domains=["http://localhost:3000"], allowed_methods=["POST"])
def model_status(request):
    user_data = get_user_data(request["query"]["user_id"])
    run_id = user_data.get("run_id")
    if not run_id:
        return { "healthy": False, "model_id": None }
    run = FinetuningRun(id=run_id)
    run.refresh()
    model = run.deployed_model.baseten_model
    return {
        "healthy": model.status == "MODEL_READY" if model else False,
        "model_id": model.id if model else None
    }
```

**Endpoint for calling the model**

Lastly, we'll the inference API to call the deployed model. This is a light wrapper around the SDK to pass the user instance to the model. The Baseten model will call the model and upload the output to a publicly accessible URL.
```python
@route(path="/call_model", allowed_domains=["http://localhost:3000"])
def call_model(request):
    request_body = request["body"]
    instance_prompt = request_body.get("instance_prompt")
    run_id = request_body.get("run_id")
    run = FinetuningRun(run_id)
    model = run.deployed_model
    image, url = model(instance_prompt)
    return {
        "url": url
    }
```

### Create inference UI

Lastly, we'll write some front-end to take some user input, and upon clicking a button hit the call model endpoint, and show the image to the user.

Sign up and/or login at `http://localhost:3000/login`, and get started!

## Hosting the model on Vercel

This was a simple NextJS app that can be hosted on Vercel. Follow [Vercel's NextJS tutorial](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/nextjs) to get started.

There will be two additional steps to make this all work end-to-end:

* Update the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` environment variables
* Update the allowed-domains in the Blueprint routes to includes the URL of the hosted site

```python
@route(path="/fine_tune_model", allowed_domains=["http://localhost:3000", "your-domain-on-vercel"], allowed_methods=["POST"])
```
